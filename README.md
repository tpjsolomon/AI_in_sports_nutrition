<p><strong>Aim:</strong><br>
This study aimed to compare the validity (accuracy), completeness, clarity/coherence, quality of cited evidence, and test-retest reliability of several publicly available chatbots — ChatGPT (OpenAI), Gemini (Google), and Claude (Anthropic) — in generating sports nutrition information.</p>

<p><strong>Hypothesis:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>The null hypothesis (Ho) was that AI chatbots cannot provide high-quality (valid/accurate, complete, clear/coherent, and reliable) sports nutrition information supported by high-quality evidence.</li>
    <li>The alternative hypothesis (H1) was that AI chatbots can provide high-quality (valid/accurate, complete, clear/coherent, and reliable) sports nutrition information supported by high-quality evidence.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Study Design:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>In Experiment 1, two types of prompts (simple and detailed) covering two domains (Sports nutrition to support training and Sports nutrition for racing) were entered into the LLM AI chatbots. The chatbot outputs were assessed against sports nutrition guidelines to rate accuracy, completeness, additional info quality, clarity/coherence, and quality of cited evidence. The test-retest reliability of these metrics was also determined.</li>
    <li>In Experiment 2, the same chatbots were challenged with exam questions and output accuracy and test-retest reliability of accuracy was determined.</li>
</ul>

<p>This notebook contains the R code used to analyze the data in <bold>Experiment 2</bold>.</p>
